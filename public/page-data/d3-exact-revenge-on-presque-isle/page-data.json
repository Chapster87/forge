Cochran was able to add the conversion and things were looking bright for the Forge. The Scallywag defense would tighten up however and prevent this game from being a shoot-out.</p>\n<p>At twenty four minutes, the Forge would be threatening again deep inside the Scallywag defensive zone, but Presque Isle was able to pounce on a quick turnover quickly carry the ball down field for an unconverted try from their outside center. Then, just four minutes later, Forge lock <strong>Roy Wotring</strong> would go to the sin-bin for a high tackle and the Forge were on their heels a bit down a man and facing some Scallywag momentum. The Forge would play stout defense with only fourteen men and even get a brilliant score from scrumhalf <strong>Nick Cardamone</strong> (<em>SRU</em>) who was able to slice through the Presque Isle defense on his way to a long try that would put the Forge up by nine after the Cochran kick at the thirty-two minute mark.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1345\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1345\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1345\" src=\"https://pghrugby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/yhongd3florence-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://pghrugby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/yhongd3florence-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://pghrugby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/yhongd3florence-300x169.jpg 300w, https://pghrugby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/yhongd3florence-768x432.jpg 768w, https://pghrugby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/yhongd3florence-600x338.jpg 600w, https://pghrugby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/yhongd3florence.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1345\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fullback Yhong Thepboon carries the ball down the sideline as the Forge crowd looks on against the Presque Isle Scallywags.

It took only seven minutes for those adjustments to pay dividends as Jacobs was able to power his way to his seventh try of the season and give the Forge a 21 – 12 lead after the Cochran kick.</p>\n<p>For the next twenty-five minutes, Presque Isle would threaten but the Forge defensive effort was strong lead by eighth man <strong>Mike Boyd</strong> (<em>Cal</em>) and then his replacement <strong>David Gregg</strong> (<em>IUP</em>); flankers <strong>Nick Eritz</strong> (<em>Cal</em>) and <strong>Jackson Allen</strong>; the fantastic boot of Cochran; and the superb three quarters play of winger <strong>Jurnee Wilson</strong> (<em>Cal</em>).</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1342\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1342\" class=\"wp-image-1342 size-large\" src=\"https://pghrugby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/forgedefensecodyfulton-1024x681.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"452\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1342\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The tough Forge defense stands against Presque Isle led by David Gregg making the tackle.
