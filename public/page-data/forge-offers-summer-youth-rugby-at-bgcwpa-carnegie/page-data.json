Current player and alumni volunteers from the Forge will be instructing children ages 5 &#8211; 13 every Tuesday and Thursday beginning today, June 11th, through August 15th. This will be the Forge’s first effort in directly facilitating youth rugby programming in addition to currently supporting independent programs in both Moon Township and the North Hills via grants and in-kind donations.</p>\n<p>This youth initiative, and all charitable giving, is being managed by the club’s Community Rugby Committee which is directed by <strong>Brooke Gawlas</strong>, a Community Reinvestment Act Officer for Washington Financial Bank. The committee is dedicated to finding the best ways to reinvest club assets towards the organization&#8217;s charitable mission of growing rugby and improving the game in our area. Such initiatives include, but are not limited to, hosting developmental and education clinics for coaches, players, and referees; offering youth and high school rugby programming to area athletes; and financially supporting other area rugby organizations and players through grants and donations.</p>\n<p>Speaking specifically regarding the partnership with the Boys &amp; Girls Club, Brooke remarked: “Fostering the growth of participation in Rugby Union is at the forefront of the Pittsburgh Forge’s mission. It is through these volunteer efforts that we are not only able act on our mission, but also give back to the local communities that we call home and support vital organizations like the Boys &amp; Girls Club.”</p>\n<p>For more information on this youth program and the Forge Grant Program, please e-mail the club at <a href=\"mailto:PGHForgeRugby@gmail.com\">PGHForgeRugby@gmail.com</a></p>\n","date":"June 11, 2019","tags":[{"name":"boys &amp; girls club"},{"name":"boys and girls club of western pa"},{"name":"brooke gawlas"},{"name":"community reinvestment"},{"name":"community rugby"},{"name":"Forge grant program"},{"name":"grow the game"}],"categories":[{"name":"General Club News"}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b38b5eb3-f4bf-5d3c-bc30-035ad4c44f21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1952065812","3128451518","3360639079","3649515864"]}
