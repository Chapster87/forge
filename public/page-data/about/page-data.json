Since that time, they’ve grown to be the largest club in the City of Pittsburgh, contending for a Division I National Championship in 1987 and most recently fielding two full sides.</p>\n<p>In the 1990&#8217;s, the Pittsburgh Rugby Club added a women’s side, the Pittsburgh Angels. The Angels enjoyed tremendous success, competing for National titles each year throughout the late 2010&#8217;s before winning back to back Division 2 National Championships in 2012 and 2014, and making the jump to Division 1 in 2015.</p>\n<p>The Pittsburgh Highlanders were originally founded as the Westmoreland Highlanders in Latrobe, PA in 1983. In the late 2000&#8217;s, the club was re-branded as the Pittsburgh Highlanders and founded a women’s side, the Lady Highlanders. In recent years, the Highlanders enjoyed tremendous growth and success on the field, being a dominant force at the Division 3 level throughout the Midwest, but failing to reach USA Rugby National Championship playoffs.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the leadership of the Pittsburgh Rugby Club met with the Pittsburgh Highlanders to spearhead a campaign that many in the Pittsburgh Rugby community spoke about, but failed to act upon. The goal was to consolidate resources into one organization in an effort to create a premier men and women’s rugby club with the capabilities to compete nationally at multiple levels while working cohesively on the betterment of the rugby community in and around Pittsburgh. Each club decided it was necessary to build off their current club heritages, maintaining key components from each club, but creating an all new entity: the <strong>Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club</strong>.</p>\n","date":"September 14, 2016","acf":{"alt_page_title":"About the Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club"}},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3a08698e-0818-5a43-8e49-9648567732b1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1952065812","3128451518","3360639079","3649515864"]}
