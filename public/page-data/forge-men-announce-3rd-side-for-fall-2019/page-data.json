This social/ developmental side will play three or four games, predominantly at home, alongside the club’s competitive Division 2 and Division 3 sides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the side is to allow players who are unable to regularly attend training sessions, participate in weekly league matches, and travel regionally for games to stay involved with the sport they love while assisting full-time club players who are developing their skills in an effort to make the club’s competitive top two sides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men’s players interested in participating in matches this fall should complete the following tasks:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Register to play part-time with the Forge and choose your Fall 2019 availability <a href=\"https://forms.gle/gko5b8gUsc2HfVcC6\">here</a>.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay Bronze (General) Membership Dues to the Club <a href=\"https://pghrugby.com/product/club-membership\">here</a>.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Register with USA Rugby for the Pittsburgh Forge <a href=\"https://webpoint.usarugby.org/\">here</a>.*</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>*Please note that the annual CIPP cycle runs from August to July.
