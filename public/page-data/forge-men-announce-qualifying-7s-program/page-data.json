The training sessions will be centrally located in the City of Pittsburgh and will occur twice per week. Specific training days, times, and locations will be announced soon. There will be a nominal dues structure for all players participating in the program with costs specific to tournaments and travel to be paid by those who are selected or choose to attend each tournament event.
