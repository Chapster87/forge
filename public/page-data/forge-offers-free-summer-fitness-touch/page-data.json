Often the club needed to set up multiple fields to accommodate 6 or so teams playing each night. In addition to being attended by current Forge players, the sessions were also attended by other area senior clubs, Forge men and women’s alumni, and a number of collegiate players home for the summer. Last season, the Forge charged $20 for all participants, but this season, thanks to the generosity of the club and the Pittsburgh Public School District, the Tuesday/Thursday fitness and touch sessions will be free of charge.</p>\n<p>For any players interested in participating in Summer 7’s Tournaments this year, they should attend a touch session and get in touch with men and women’s side leadership. Both the men and women plan on attending a number of regional social tournaments including Rock ‘N Roll 7’s in Cleveland, Hall of Fam 7’s in Canton,  and of course, the Forge’s own tournament, Steel City 7’s, on July 20<sup>th</sup>. There will be a cost for each player planning to attend any of these tournaments and some additional training may be held the week leading up to each tournament.</p>\n<p>For more information regarding the club’s free fitness and touch 7’s programming, or information regarding our Summer 7’s Tournament schedule, please contact the club or visit our Facebook page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","date":"June 04, 2019","tags":[{"name":"billy gordon"},{"name":"brooke gawlas"},{"name":"community programming"},{"name":"phillip murray"},{"name":"pittsburgh forge"},{"name":"rugby fitness"},{"name":"summer 7s"},{"name":"touch 7s"}],"categories":[{"name":"General Club News"}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"82615dc0-cdf3-53be-88a9-f0f68a639864"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1952065812","3128451518","3360639079","3649515864"]}
