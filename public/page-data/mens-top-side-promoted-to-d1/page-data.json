The Midwest Premiership is the Division 1 competition for the Midwest Competitive Region (CR) and features some of the best competition in the county.</p>\n<p>The men’s top side will compete in the CR’s Eastern Conference playing a home and away series against Scioto Valley RFC, the Cincinnati Wolfhounds, the Detroit Tradesmen, the Chicago Griffins, and the Chicago Lions. At the conclusion of each fall, the club on top of the table in the East will play the best side from the West in the Midwest Championship. Western clubs include the Kansas City Blues, Metropolis Rugby, Palmer College Dragons, the St. Louis Bombers, the Milwaukee Barbarians, and newly promoted Wisconsin Rugby Club. The Midwest Champion would then play the champion of the Atlantic Rugby Premiership (ARP) to close out the fall in what’s known as the Elite Cup.</p>\n<p>Although not official yet, the Forge men’s side expect promotion of both the second side to D2 and their third side to D3. This will allow more conducive player movement between sides and allow for all three sides to complete for a National Championship. The Forge is thrilled to offer competitive rugby at all three levels this fall.
