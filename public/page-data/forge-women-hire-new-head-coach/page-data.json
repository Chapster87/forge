In his first season there, Alex led the club to the State Championship and finished as Runner-Up and was subsequently named the Coach of the Year by Rugby Texas.  Alex coached the Kingwood HS Boys for another three years, finishing third in the state in 2015. </p>\n<p>In the summer of 2015, Alex took on the challenge of forming a senior level men’s club in northeast Houston, something that had never been done before.  Alex named the club the Kingwood Crusaders, and served as their President and Coach until 2017, even stepping on the field as a Scrumhalf as needed, despite being well into his sixties, when the program’s numbers were wavering in the early years. </p>\n<p>In 2017, Alex returned to Mission, Texas and rejoined the McAllen Knights as their coach. In 2018, Alex founded the McAllen Maidens Women’s side where he’s coached since.  In the spring of 2020, Alex was inducted into the Texas Rugby Union Hall of Fame for his lifetime of hard work and success in rugby.</p>\n<p>For more information regarding playing or coaching opportunities with the Pittsburgh Forge, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:PGHForgeRugby@gmail.com\">PGHForgeRugby@gmail.com</a>.</p>\n","date":"May 12, 2020","tags":[{"name":"alex ramirez"},{"name":"forge women"},{"name":"pittsburgh forge"},{"name":"pittsburgh forge women"}],"categories":[{"name":"General Club News"}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"149b4263-84cc-50ee-ab50-2fa1f3539c53"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1952065812","3128451518","3360639079","3649515864"]}
