The women’s side consists of forty-nine (49) registered players with thirty-five (35) regularly attending training and games.  The Forge women went undefeated in their inaugural regular season (2018) and made it to Midwest Playoffs in each of their first two seasons. They are also actively developing a second side while searching for a Head Coach for immediate hire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Head Coach is expected to make a commitment of time, energy, and effort to the development of our women&#8217;s side. All </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the club’s sides compete in a fall XV’s season. Due to MCR seasonality, the spring </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">season is a mixture of friendly matches, tours, tournaments, &#8216;Select Side&#8217; competition and qualifying </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">matches (if the USAR playoffs are achieved).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Forge trains twice per week in the evenings and plays approximately six (6) league matches per season (per </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">side). Away fixtures could be as far as five (5) hours in some cases. Friendly matches, tournaments, and playoff competition have taken us to places like Tennessee, the Carolinas, Florida and Iowa. The team would require the  coach to also attend team meetings, serve on some committees, and be available to conduct individual feedback sessions at the coach’s discretion. The Head Coach would also have the ability to build a coaching staff for assistance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Head Coach would be expected to lead the team in providing development to all of the players, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">regardless of level and skill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expectations include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must USA Rugby Level 200 Coaching Certification (Level 300 is preferred);</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ability to create game strategies and develop players of all skill levels;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ability to coach both forwards and backs;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regularly attendance at games and training sessions;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possess strong leadership and communication skills;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possess a motivation to continue rugby education and to build one’s knowledge set;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research opponents for appropriate game prep;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be accessible for players to request feedback regarding game play, fitness, rugby IQ, etc.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What we have to offer to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A seasonal stipend commensurate with experience;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An atmosphere of competitive players willing to constantly learn;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large alumni network for professional connections (see “Note” below);</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professionally ran club with an active Board of Directors.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If interested, please provide the following to <a style=\"font-size: inherit;\" href=\"mailto:PGHForgeRugby@gmail.com\">PGHForgeRugby@gmail.com</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional Resume;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rugby Resume;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least one (1) rugby reference;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An explanation of coaching style, strategy, and any additional information you deem necessary to share.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will be accepting coaching applications throughout the winter months in hopes or hiring a permanent coach for the Spring 2020 season.
